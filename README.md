# A bootloader for SN32F2x-based keyboards
## Compiling

A recent version of the [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm) is recommended for building this project. In order to build, execute the following commands:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchain/gcc.cmake
make -j8
```

## Flashing the bootloader

The bootloader is flashed with the [Womier Flasher](https://github.com/xyzz/womier-flasher).

NOTES:
- if you are using different flasher make sure to pad compiled jumploader up to 512 size with zeros and flash it at offset 0x0
This can be done on linux using the following command, be sure to replace jumploader-redragon_k556.bin with your keyboads jumploader.

```truncate -s 512 jumploader-redragon_k556.bin```

## Entering the bootloader

The bootloader is entered when any of the following is true during power up:

- A bootloader entry flag is set - this would be set by QMK when you press the `RESET` keycode.
- There is no firmware uploaded yet - this works by checking the validity of the reset vector (only checks the stack pointer)
- A button is pressed (inherited from the parent project, but not really used)
- A button from the keyboard matrix is pressed - this should be the main method used to enter the bootloader.

The last method is new to this fork. It enters the bootloader if a keyboard button is held during power up, i.e. a user holds a specific button while plugging in the keyboard. This is safer compared to QMK bootmagic feature as it does not rely on a valid firmware being present.

The specific button to be held will be different depending on the keyboard. See below on how to configure it.

## Flashing keyboard firmware

The QMK firmware can be flashed with the [Womier Flasher](https://github.com/xyzz/womier-flasher).

NOTES:
- qmk firmware have to be compiled/linked with 0x200 offset in linked script and size = [full size - jumploader size (0x200)] see note about flashing bootloader

for example for SN32F248B linked script will look like this:

path: qmk_firmware\lib\chibios-contrib\os\common\startup\ARMCMx\compilers\GCC\ld\SN32F240B.ld

modified content:

```
    MEMORY
    {
        flash0 (rx) : org = 0x00000200, len = 64k - 0x200
```
- flash compiled qmk firmware at offset 0x200 (size should be 65024)
- mem layout example for SN32F248B:

```
0x00000000   compiled jumploader (purpose to jump to qmk or bootloader)
0x00000200   qmk firmware (size 64k - 0x200)
0x1FFF0000   original bootloader
0x20000000   ram space
```

## Adding a new keyboard

To add a new keyboard, first edit `CMakeLists.txt` and append a new `add_bootloader()` entry at the end, e.g.

```
add_bootloader(new_keyboard)
```

Then, edit `src/config.h` and before the `#else` with the `#error` branch, add:

```
#elif defined(TARGET_NEW_KEYBOARD)
/* Configuration options - see other entries for a reference */
```

Finally, recompile the project and you should see your very own `bootloader-new_keyboard.bin` in the build folder. See flashing instructions above for how to flash.

Before releasing your product, you should configure a way to enter the bootloader. The recommended way is by holding a keyboard matrix button on power up.

Suppose you want to enter the bootloader when K_4, the middle button in the matrix is held during power up. To scan that single keycode, we need the bootloader to output on `col1` (PB10) and read the result from `row1` (PA4). The following snippet from `config.h` properly sets it up:

```
#elif defined(TARGET_BASICPAD_V1)
    /* Middle key in the 3x3 keymatrix */
    #define BL_OUTPUT_BANK GPIOB
    #define BL_OUTPUT_PIN 10
    #define BL_INPUT_BANK GPIOA
    #define BL_INPUT_PIN 4
```
For matrices with optical switches when key is held the read pin values is 1 instead of 0 thus return value should be inverted. Use define to revert it. See KEYCHRON_K7_RGB_OPTICAL example.
```
#define PIN_HIGH_WHEN_KEY_HELD 1
```
